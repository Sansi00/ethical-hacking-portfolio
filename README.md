Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on ethical hacking and security labs: VM setup, reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and packet analysis. Each lab includes a short writeup, commands used, screenshots, and links to full artifacts (PCAPs, VM snapshots) hosted privately on OneDrive.
